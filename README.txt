---- BRP Puzzle Challenge - Python Developer Application ----

Hello, BRP Team! 
Thank you for taking the time to check out my project! I’m Victor, a Full Stack Software Engineer passionate about solving problems through code and creating memorable experiences.

---- How It Works ----

This is a simple yet fun interactive puzzle built with Python + HTML/CSS/JS. When executed, it:

1️⃣ Generates a local HTML file with a puzzle split into 6 pieces.
2️⃣ Challenges the recruiter to solve it by dragging the pieces into the designated area.
3️⃣ Rewards a surprise upon completion (hint: it reveals a key).
